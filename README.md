## Description
This project was created so the user is able to generate professional README.md files for their projects by providing a structured foundation which will populate by a series of questions asked to the user about their project. Once all questions have been answered the generator will use the answers to create a README.md file that should be ready for deployment. Creating this project helped me get more comfortable using the terminal and node.js, as well as to get a grasp on how powerful and useful node.js can be.

## Installation
To install this project the user will need to have Node.js installed, as well as inquirer, which can be downloaded in the terminal using node itself. Once thatâ€™s done the user will need to clone this repo and run index.js from the terminal.

## Usage
This project can be used to create a README.md file for any project the user may have. As an example, this README.MD file was created using the README generator itself.
